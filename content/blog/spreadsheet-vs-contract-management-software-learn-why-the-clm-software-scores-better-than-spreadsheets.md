We all love spreadsheets, don’t we? They are the most basic and the easiest way to create a database. From recording employee details to creating sophisticated, formula-based data, spreadsheets are the most popular choice for organizations of varied verticals. However, how relevant and useful is a spreadsheet in 2021? Is recording information in a spreadsheet better than using proprietary technology? Even today, several organizations use the spreadsheet to record crucial information, although they are creeping towards their obsolescence. Especially, when it comes to contracts, using a spreadsheet tends to invite adverse consequences due to its archaic nature and the lack of contemporary features. [Contract management software](https://docucollab.com/contract-management-software/) is designed to provide users with the ultimate experience of managing contracts seamlessly. We’ve created a list of differences between spreadsheet and contract management software to highlight the benefits of adopting an agile system.

## 1. Repository

One of the biggest challenges faced by organizations when it comes to contracts is the issue of storage. The spreadsheet albeit enables to track the contract details, it doesn’t serve the purpose of storing the contracts. Spreadsheets are often saved as files in the system and there isn’t a particular destination or dedicated storage system for such files. With [contract lifecycle management software](https://docucollab.com/contract-management-software/), however, the team can store the contracts in its unified repository and help to track them effectively.

**The Benefit:**

Store unlimited contract documents and contract-related documents in software’s repository system.

When it comes to dealing with contracts, such basic security does not cut corners. Contracts must be dealt with utmost security since they contain sensitive information. [Contract management software systems](https://docucollab.com/contract-management-software/) possess sophisticated security protocols, where security can be established right from a paragraph level.

## 3. Collaboration

Contemporary [contract management system software](https://docucollab.com/contract-management-software/) enables users to collaborate with ease. With the software, the involved parties can collaborate in real-time and make changes in the document instantly.

It increases the chance for errors and extends the time factor by manifold.

Collaborate in real-time and make changes in the documents, thereby saving time.

## 4. Execution

A contract to be executed must possess the signatures of all the involved stakeholders. Contract Management in spreadsheet requires an extra effort from the team, where the completed documents are sent via mail to the stakeholders to procure their signatures. The stakeholders, further download the file to sign it in the hardcopy, scan it and revert the document. The process is long and tedious and increases risks. With agile software, the team can procure the signatures instantly via eSignature feature.

**The Benefit:**

The eSignature feature expedites the process of executing the contracts instantly.
