Sales proposal – may sound as a dreadful word for any salesperson, especially when you don’t know where to start. When a prospect asks you to send a proposal, you may consider that you have the deal in the bag, however the reality is that you still have a long way to go. The best approach rarely is to open a blank document and start typing. Instead, you should take a pause and think about how you are able to use the proposal process as an opportunity advancement process.

There are several types of proposals – the short ones that only confirms in writing what you have agreed with your prospect; and more detailed ones that require more input. Whichever type of proposal you are on, the winning factor is creating a document that has tested and proven structure which can later be applied to any type of proposal. 

# Characteristics of a low IQ proposal

First of all, let us understand the meaning of a “low IQ proposal”. It can be defined as a poorly drafted document that consists of a bunch of unnecessary sections. For example, you try to define your clients’ needs, requirements which they already know, you either speak too much about yourself or copy and paste sections from your client’s website – all of it gives a bad impression and does not build trust.

It takes quite a bit of thinking and experience to draft a proposal that actually resonates with the mindset of reader. Unfortunately, most people tend to start with their last written proposal and start stitching various pieces of content that they can get their hands on and they end up with a low IQ proposal at their hands.

## **There are some easy ways to spot a low IQ proposals**

- **Low IQ sales proposals are hard to write**

Contrary to what may seem obvious, a low IQ proposal is extremely hard to write because as you keep reading it over and over again, you will keep finding more and more issues with the content. If the content of the proposal keeps changing until the time of submission, you know that you have a low IQ proposal.

- **Low IQ proposals have incoherent messaging**

If you find yourself struggling to make sense of various sections of the proposal because various sections sound different in your head, that’s generally a good indicator that your proposal has incoherence is thoughts. The response for each section must follow the same language/narration style or else you run the risk of losing the reader.  Proposals that are created in last minute by copy-pasting sections from other past proposals generally show these symptoms.

- **Low IQ proposal are often sent back to drawing board during review process**

When the proposals go for review, reviewers will provide a plethora of scattered feedback because they could not understand the crux of a sales proposal at all. How many times have you had the senior executive reject a draft because it just did not make sense? Executives generally have a broader perspective and their response would somewhat echo the mind of the prospect as well.

- **Low IQ proposals are of bad quality**

How many times have you seen bad examples of proposals which made you think “who can actually do business with this company?” Here you go – another example of a poor proposal. There are many reasons why your proposal is of a bad quality: it does not convey the message, it is not legally and grammatically correct, does not have a structure. Companies who use outdated document management tools have a hard time editing a document because everyone in the  team may be using different versions of the software or it’s impossible to extract a certain data from the document (which is often the case with PDF files)

- **Low IQ sales proposals take too long to finish**

When you draft the first version of a proposal, it has to be reviewed and approved by higher authorities – most likely it will be sent back to the draft stage because it will be missing vital parts and lack important legal information. It means you have to go back to the drawing board and start again. Amendments take time, so do sending the drafts back and forth until you get the final version.
