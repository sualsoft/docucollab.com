One of the many challenges in implementing [contract lifecycle management software](https://docucollab.com/contract-management-software/) is measuring the effectiveness of the solution. Contract management software has become an integral part of organizations but not many users do not utilize the full potential of the software. Many business enterprises even with a robust [contract management for salesforce](https://docucollab.com/contract-management-software/) application struggle to measure how the features are effective and calculate the ROI. We have compiled the 3 simple ways to measure your contract effectiveness, which helps the users to quantify and understand contract effectiveness easily.

1. ## Save Time

   Most technologies are invented to cut down the operational time and costs and improve the team productivity. It is especially true in the case of the contract management process. Before the advent of advanced, tech-driven solutions, contract managers had to manually manage contracts. The time factor was one of the elements that impeded contractual progress. When the digital era began to boom, contracts were created in softcopies using operating systems. Even in this method, the users had to print out the contracts and get them signed by all the involved parties, which was a tedious and time-consuming process. With [contract management software tools](https://docucollab.com/contract-management-software/), the users can effectively cut-down the operational time and costs.

   ## 3. Save Costs

   Businesses usually conduct a cost analysis before making decisions that could transform the processes. Saving costs and overheads help organizations to channel funds to the required domains. Contract management solutions are comparatively cheaper than managing the contracts via multiple applications. Since contracts are confidential documents, a legion of experts are required to manage and monitor contracts efficiently. It increased the cost of overheads, causing the organization to look for cheaper alternatives. The cheaper alternatives proved to be less efficient and more problematic because of the safety concerns. Choosing the right solution can help the organization maintain their contract-related expenses.

   Check whether the price of the software justifies the features therein. Choose a software that has a flexible subscription plan and renders a higher ROI.

The software overcomes this barrier and helps managers get authentic and accurate information to make informed decisions. It is not only easier to procure detailed data but it can be stored for future reference.
