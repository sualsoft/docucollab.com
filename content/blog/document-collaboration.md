If you look at the bigger picture of your company, you’ll most likely agree that documents and data forms an integral part of it. Just think about the daily processes – sales teams rely on correct client data, HR department is dealing with loads of training and onboarding material, the finance department is working with confidential and business-sensitive information. Documents are a necessary part of any organization and quickly becoming more collaborative in nature. As organizations move toward digitizing their business processes, the collaborative document editing and review performed using emails and word processors tend to be more problematic, error-prone and fragile.

Let us discuss the main problems that arise when you edit and review your documents via email:

1. **Time-consuming** – in the situation where you have to work on a document with more than two persons, the task of reviewing and editing a document becomes much more difficult: you receive several versions of the same document and need to ensure all edits are incorporated into one final version.
2. **Lack of traceability** – it’s impossible to track the changes made on the document when you check it on email, unless the person adds their name and the date and the time when the document was last changed.
3. **Version control** – by editing document via email there’s a risk of working on the old version of a document and even worse – you can finish and send the incorrect, old version of the document.
4. **Email overload** – emails are not only restricting (you cannot exceed a certain file size when adding an attachment) but also can quickly overflow your inbox. If you imagine that with each small document update you are receiving an email with an attachment, it quickly becomes messy and you can get lost in different versions very easy.
5. **Security** – based on the findings by [Breach Level Index](https://blog.gemalto.com/security/2016/09/20/data-breach-statistics-2016-first-half-results/), 554 million records have been lost or stolen in 2016 so companies should really take care of how they handle their documents. If you accidentally send an email to a wrong person containing sensitive client information, your company may be in trouble. Emails are not a secure way of sharing documents yet many companies still practice this method.

All of the above problems can be easily solved with a document collaboration software.
