In today’s digital world, securing your assets in the most optimal way is perhaps one of the most challenging decisions that an organization can take. When it comes to security, we believe that the more is in fact the merrier. Unethical entities have countless tools to attack a moderately secure system to steal data, which could hurt the financial standing of a company. Especially, industries that deal with highly sensitive information are prone to such external and internal attacks. Docucollab’s [Contract management software](https://docucollab.com/contract-management-software/) will help organizations to protect and store Contracts securely. Contracts possess some of the most crucial information, which requires extensive security. We have compiled a list of key security elements for you to check off your document security checklist.

## 1. Double Check on Your Cyber Security

There have been quite a few instances, where an internal failure of the cybersecurity protocols have led to a phenomenal loss of confidential information. Hackers target the weak spots in your security walls and try to break in through such lapses. Once they infiltrate your systems, your data becomes vulnerable and open to unethical hackers. It is imperative to protect your digital assets by implementing strong cybersecurity protocols and upgrading them on a regular basis to avoid any mishaps.

## 2. Educating Your Workforce

Many security breaches have occurred in the past due to the negligence of the workforce. It is essential to educate the workforce on the possible security risks and how to manage them. Some of the most popular threats include malware, spyware, ransomware, phishing etc, can be effectively avoided and overcome by teaching your employees the risks involved. The in-house IT team must ensure that the entire workforce complies with the security protocols through constant monitoring and supervision. Educating your workforce enables them to distinguish between normal mail and spyware that could take the entire system down.

## 3. Constant Review of Internal Systems

Although most of the cyber attacks stem from external sources, it is the internal lapses that cause them to break into your systems. While you might have the top of the grade cybersecurity measures and training sessions for employees, it is equally important to conduct a regular review of the established systems. Getting a seasoned cybersecurity agency to test your system’s security regularly is the best way to avoid security breaches. Consistent internal reviews allow the team to be ahead of the external threats and ensures that the overall security of confidential information is under scrutiny.

## 4. Security in Software

When it comes to managing your contracts and subsidiary documents, the security factor is of paramount importance. Companies that follow a traditional method of creating and storing contract documents are at a higher risk of losing confidential information to cyber attacks. Contract management software is the ideal choice for organizations to protect their contracts and store them securely. With [contract management software](https://docucollab.com/contract-management-software/) the team can ensure that only the authorized parties would have access to important documents, thereby saving data from internal breaches. Apart from this, the software also enables the users to assign security as a minimum as at a paragraph level! The important parts of a document can be hidden from unauthorized people, thereby ensuring security and integrity.

## 5. Cloud Security

A problem that most organizations face during remote working is the problem of unencrypted devices and poorly secured networks of the workforce. The workforce which had been scattered due to the pandemic had to resort to their devices and networks to log in to the company portal and continue their business affairs. During this period, the number of companies whose data was stolen from their employees’ unencrypted devices rose phenomenally. With [enterprise contract management software](https://docucollab.com/contract-management-software/), the team can safely sign in to the software, thereby establishing a strong and secure network.
