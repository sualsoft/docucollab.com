Transitioning from a manual contract management method to a fully-functional contract management software is one of the best decisions that an organization can make. In today’s digital world, leveraging enterprise technology in expediting business affairs has become a necessity. The [vendor contract management software](https://docucollab.com/contract-management-software/) possesses crucial features that simplifies, enhances, streamlines and hones the entire contract management workflow. However, switching to a high-performing system can pose a few challenges, which requires the expertise of contract experts. We have listed a few pointers to get the most out of your CLM software and quickly start your contract management journey without a hitch.

## 1. Categorization for Seamless Management

The nature of contract greatly varies with the scope, industry application, the type of business and the prevailing legislations of the land. For instance, a healthcare provider, who’s switching to the [contract lifecycle management software](https://docucollab.com/contract-management-software/), will be required to segregate their existing contract repository optimally. The CLM software offers flexibility when it comes to managing contracts, where the users can create endless workspaces and sub-categories, under which the existing contracts can be uploaded and classified accordingly. From employee contracts to patient contracts, the healthcare provider can make the most of the available features to streamline and monitor contracts effectively.
