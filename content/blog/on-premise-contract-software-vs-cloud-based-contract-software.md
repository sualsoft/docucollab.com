One of the most common questions clients ask a business analyst when selecting contract lifecycle management software is whether to go with cloud contract management software or on-premise contract management software. It is more likely compared between the operating systems, whether it is Mac or Windows. Both cloud-based contract management software and on-premises contract management software have their own advantages and disadvantages. Continue reading this blog to learn about the factors to consider when deciding between cloud and on-premise contract lifecycle management software.

## Expense:

When considering whether to use cloud contract automation software versus on-premise [contract management software](https://docucollab.com/contract-management-software/), this is perhaps the most significant thing to take into account. As a result of the need to purchase internal server hardware, pay for the software license, extend the deployment period, and employ an internal team of IT-skilled professionals, the expenses for the latter are higher upfront. On-premise contract software’s cost of ownership eventually becomes less expensive than the cloud system that is based on subscriptions. On-premise systems only require infrequent maintenance fees after the initial upfront investment, whereas cloud-based contract systems demand continuing, permanent payments every year or month. The subscription model offered by the cloud service providers, however, is an excellent substitute that is also very cost-effective. Clients who use this method receive a contract management system that almost perfectly meets their needs and are given the option to upgrade as their IT infrastructure develops. For this precise reason, the majority of small and medium-sized firms regard cloud computing as the ideal legal contract software.

## Confidentiality:

One of the few similarities between contract software that is managed on-premises and cloud-based, however, is that this is the main cause of clients’ reluctance to use cloud computing. Even while cloud contract software is just as safe and secure as an on-premise system, many clients still prefer to keep sensitive information like customer information and proprietary corporate information inside their own firewalls as opposed to the vendors’. Clients are also guaranteed, with an on-premises solution, that the stored data complies with the business’s backup and privacy policies. The suppliers are responsible for the system’s overall management and data security in the case of cloud-based software systems.

## Integrity and Customization Tiers:

Since not all cloud solutions offer complete customization, a circumstance like this can necessitate the installation of on-premise contract software. In that instance, it must be made very clear what level and type of customization are necessary to best meet the needs of the client. The level of integration needed between the upcoming contract system and the currently running applications is another top consideration for businesses when switching to an on-premise or cloud system. When switching to the new contract software system, many organizations must go through extensive integrations to alter equally extensive amounts of data.

## Automated access:

The ability to access corporate information from any location using a laptop or a smartphone is one of the key selling advantages. With cloud service providers now creating specialised mobile apps that make remote access even simpler and quicker, this has received a significant boost. The remote access feature is unquestionably not a special feature and is exclusive to cloud environments. In particular, contract software that’s also installed on-site facilitates remote access with the use of a VPN provider that enables an off-site connection. However, on-premises will also save you money because you won’t be charged for each extra collaborator you add to the system to use the remote access capability.
